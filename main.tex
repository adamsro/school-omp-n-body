The purpose of this assignment is to experiment with and benchmark speedups gained from using OpenMP on a calculation intensive for loop.


\section{Results}

What do you think the actual volume is?

I think the actual volume is something around 14.069482




The for loop run on a single thread remains constant; the loop run with threads looks to become more efficient as the number of elements increase. Since my machine has only two cores with hyperthreading I will only see performance gains for up to 4 threads. 8 threads may be slightly slower due to the overhead of creation. 



	The performance dip between 100 and 1000 elements is of interest. This may have something to do with either the sharing of a variable or cache misses. I, however, do not see how.  I’ve set the loop with reduction(+:volume) to prevent sharing of this variable, keeping it from being continually reloaded in the L3. It’s possible this dip has something to do with the OSX scheduler de-prioritizing the process.
